1. * getElementById(): It is used when the element is detected by ID.
   * getElementByClassName(): It is used to detect all elements that contain the same class name.

   * querySelectorAll(): It returns all matching elements.
  
2. For creating an element, we use "const newDiv = document.createElement("div"); After creating an element, we append it to the parent div or set innerHTML.

3. Event bubbling is the event propagation method. When an event  occurs in an element, it propagates to the upper branch of the DOM tree.
4. Event delegation is a JavaScript pattern where we set the single event listener in the parent instead of setting the event listener for every child. Here event is handled in the parent.
5. PreventDefault(): It obstructs the default behaviour of the event.
   stopPropagation(): It stops the event bubbling of DOM tree.
